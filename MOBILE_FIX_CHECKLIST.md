# Mobile Image Display Fix - Deployment Checklist

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Image Size Optimization**
- ✅ Large image files (ship.png: 2MB) can cause loading issues on mobile networks
- ✅ Added proper image compression handling in Vite config
- ✅ Set assetInlineLimit to optimize small images

### 2. **Mobile Responsive Styling**
- ✅ Added mobile-specific CSS media queries for vehicle images
- ✅ Responsive sizing: 50vw on desktop, 70vw on tablet, 80vw on mobile
- ✅ Added max-width constraints to prevent oversized images
- ✅ Adjusted border thickness for different screen sizes

### 3. **Image Loading Optimization**
- ✅ Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to all vehicle images
- ✅ Added `decoding="async"` for better performance
- ✅ Added proper alt text for accessibility
- ✅ Enhanced image rendering for mobile devices

### 4. **Performance Improvements**
- ✅ Added image-rendering optimizations
- ✅ Added touch-action optimization for mobile interactions
- ✅ Configured Vite for better asset handling

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Push changes to your Git repository
   - Vercel will automatically redeploy

## Testing Recommendations:

### After deployment, test on mobile:
1. **Network throttling**: Test with slow 3G to simulate poor mobile networks
2. **Different devices**: Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
3. **Image loading**: Ensure all vehicle images appear properly
4. **Performance**: Check loading times and responsiveness

## Additional Optimizations (Optional):

### Image Compression:
Consider compressing your images further:
- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
- Convert to WebP format for better compression
- Consider using responsive images with different sizes

### Advanced Image Loading:
If issues persist, consider:
- Implementing progressive image loading
- Using the OptimizedImage component created
- Adding retry mechanism for failed image loads

## Mobile-Specific CSS Added:

```css
/* Mobile optimizations */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .vehicle {
    width: 70vw;
    max-width: 250px;
    margin-top: 3vh;
    border: 3px solid red;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .vehicle {
    width: 80vw;
    max-width: 200px;
    margin-top: 2vh;
    border: 2px solid red;
  }
}
```

## Common Mobile Image Issues Resolved:

1. ✅ **Size constraints**: Images now have proper max-width
2. ✅ **Loading performance**: Lazy loading implemented
3. ✅ **Network timeouts**: Async decoding added
4. ✅ **Responsive design**: Mobile-specific breakpoints added
5. ✅ **Touch optimization**: Better mobile interaction handling
